Yes, I am aware of the Mahayana interpretation, and I reject it for the same reason I reject the Catholic church's bastardization of Jesus's message. It's not the actual faith of the Buddha.\n",

It is SUFFICIENT for such a government that the persons administering it be appointed, either directly or indirectly, by the people; and that they hold their appointments by either of the tenures just specified; otherwise every government in the United States, as well as every other popular government that has been or can be well organized or well executed, would be degraded from the republican character. \n",

In ascertaining the meaning of the phrase \"republican form of government\" the debates of the constitutional conventions and the federalist papers are of great importance, if not conclusive. The framers of the Constitution recognized the distinction between the republican and democratic form of government, and carefully avoided the latter. The extent of territory of the States alone sufficed, in the judgment of the framers of the Constitution, to condemn the establishment of a democratic form of government. The form of state government perpetuated by the Constitution was the republican form with the three departments of government, in force in all the States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. The history of other nations does not furnish the definition of the phrase \"republican form of government\" as those words were used by the framers of the Constitution. They distinguish the American from all other republics by the introduction of the principle of representation. Initiative legislation is invalid because government by the people directly is inconsistent with our form of government.

Despite the effort spent on terrorism, and its financial and civil liberty costs, over a decade there has been 24 deaths from jihadist attacks on U.S. soil compared to over 300,000 during the same time frame (I know this is cherry picking years and terror is a larger threat now, but these are just the years for which I could find accurate numbers, and the trend is the same over any period of time). 300,000 deaths in ten years is absolutely horrific to me. 300,000 people have had their lives cut short and have been taken from their friends and family; add up all of that suffering and you should be mortified.

She loved it and being a workaholic eventually rose to a point where she now travels the world, makes a ton of money, and moved to Tampa (I'm from near Philly).  All the while, I was left on my grandparents porch, since my dad wouldn't let me live with him.  Upon begging my mom to stay home more and be a mom, she basically told me her dreams were more important. She spent my teenage years buying me anything I wanted, paying for college, etc, but was never a mother.  I felt abandoned and now I don't really like being around her and never want to go see her in Tampa.  She calls me a spoiled brat that never appreciated anything she did for me, but I don't feel like I owe her or my father anything.  CMV\n",

      "[Osricthebastard]\n",
      "My argument is largely philosophical so it's somewhat malleable and I legitimately would like yo see it changed. I would prefer to believe in and support current trans activism whole-heartedly but far too often find myself shaking my head instead. There's a few points on which I base my contention:\n",
      "\n",
      "~~**As a trans woman I do not believe that I am biologically female and I dont believe that I should have to be to access women's spaces.** I'm female like and function well enough as one. I look female. I experience much of if not the majority of the same baggage as biological females. I'm more physically like a female than a male and pose about as much danger to females as any other female due to the effects of hormones. Despite this I know that if nature had been left to its own devices I would have been completely capable of reproducing through the production of male sex gametes: sperm. Furthermore I still have male reproductive organs, they've simply been switched off by the effects of long term hormone replacement therapy and potentially could function completely again on the cessation of hormones. I think it is an inherently unwinnable fight to argue that I am biologically female based on nothing more than the (potential and unproven) configuration of my brain hardware.~~\n",
      "\n",
      "~~**I have seen trans activism push an agenda that states that biological sex is an entirely socially constructed concept based on the existence of intersex people.** I think this makes about as much sense as saying that because Orange exists, red and yellow aren't real colors. Biological sex is at its core about sex gametes. In the absence of a reproductive system that functionally produces one, its relatively easy to deduce which gamete a person's biology was *intended* to  produce,  even in the presence of the overwhelming majority of intersex conditions, and even at an extreme enough end that you can argue an intersex person is not neatly either male or female, males and females still exist independent of them.~~\n",
      "\n",
      "~~**How this hurts trans activism goals:** If trans activism spent less time trying to convince people that biological sex is made up and more time educating people about the effects hormones have on trans bodies I believe that we would be much further into achieving our social and political goals by now. I believe that we are bogged down in an unwinnable and inherently disingenuous fight. We are driving away people who believe in rationalism and science a la people who would actually be very receptive to treating transgenderism as a medical condition with a very specific and unorthodox  treatment regimen and instead of trying to sway them with an argument that appeals to their natures we are fighting them with unscientific rhetoric.~~\n",
      "\n",
      "**Edit: I have actually changed my view at this point regarding biological sex. /u/convoces raised to me a really good point that if you can point to an exception within your paradigm, then the scientifically honest thing to do is rethink your paradigm. If 100% of cases do not work within it, then it was too broad. I've come to believe that sex is nuanced, and while someone might not necessarily fall within a strict \"female\" category, that does not necessarily indicate that they are males. Rather biological sex is a mix of different characteristics which are not always able to be defined neatly, and the social role a person lives in is as important if not more important than potentially invisible characteristics.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**I have seen trans activists push a \"genitals don't matter\" argument when it comes to sex and dating.** While I do not believe that a man dating a preop trans woman is \"gay\", genitals are very important to many people when it comes to sex. Trans activism states that this reduces people solely to their genitals, but it's frankly terrifyingly batshit to argue to people that the parts used in sex should not matter when it comes to sex. It is not transphobic for someone to not want a particular configuration of genitals in their bedroom. That is their prerogative.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How this hurts trans activism:** I have seen lesbians show up in /r/relationships and /r/asktransgender threads describing being shamed and ostracized by their friends for not wanting to sleep with trans women.  I have seen gay men do the same regarding trans men. The LGB community has typically had a strong association with the T community and they are all potential allies. We are united in the ways we are stigmatized. Yet, when we are the ones doing the stigmatizing we risk alienating them from our cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "~~**And lastly I have seen trans activists argue that you do not need to be gender dysphoric to be transgender, merely self identified as something other than your birth sex.** This fundamentally makes no sense and runs contrary to the entire pathology of what it means to be transgender. It's as fundamentally incorrect as arguing that gay men dont have to be sexually attracted to men to be gay, you just have to self identify. Gender dysphoria is integral to shaping a transgender identity. This particular argument seems purely ideological: that people should be allowed to identify as whatever sex they feel like because gender is dead and anything goes. I believe at minimum this actually reinforces sexist gender roles since believing that because you are effeminate or gender non-conforming as a man (or the inverse as a woman) actually makes you the other sex or a third sex undermines the progress feminism has made to insist that women can be masculine and still women or that men can be feminine still men. ~~\n",
      "\n",
      "~~**How this hurts trans activism:** after countless conversations with cis opponents of pro-trans bathroom laws I've come to the conclusion that most cisgender people could care less what someone who has transitioned does and where they go the bathroom. Their primary fear comes from the wording typically being used: \"the gender they identify as\". Cis people are most afraid of there being no standards whatsoever imposed on access to sex segregated spaces. When we're arguing that there should be no bare minimum standards for being identified as the opposite sex we are playing directly into those fears. When cis people are afraid that men will \"wake up and decide they are a woman\" why are we arguing \"that's not how it works!\" then turning around and in different conversations arguing that its exactly how it works?~~\n",
      "\n",
      "~~**In summation:** I believe that by embracing radical and untrue tenents based on ideological goals rather than objective reality trans activism is actually driving away potential supporters and otherwise reasonable people who could be potential allies.~~\n",
      "\n",
      "**Edit: Thanks to /u/iyzie pointing out the scary possibility or republican lawmakers being charged by the evangelical right with determining who is and isn't transgender enough I've partially changed my view on \"non-dysphoric trans people\". I haven't necessarily changed my view that they are not actually transgender people, only that it is dangerous to start drawing lines in the sand to determine who is and is not legitimate, and that once you establish that power for a reasonable group it becomes easier for unreasonable groups to seize that power. So what I have changed my view on is that trans activists pushing the view that \"anyone can be trans\" is not necessarily harmful because they are rightfully trying to avoid a legitimate slippery slope.\n",

If everyone cheats the system some people will be better off but others will be worse off, the groups as a whole suffers.

If wealthy people were paying their share, there should be a tremendous surplus, not the tremendous deficit that exists today. All of that is just to cover up the small amount they even report as taxable earnings, most of the money can be funneled offshores through shell corporations and completely evade taxes.
