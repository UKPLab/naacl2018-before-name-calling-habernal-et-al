{"archived": true, "author_name": "Becquerine", "body": "I think you all know what I'm talking about. When a pet dies, or a relative falls terminally ill, or a family friend commits suicide, we silence the discussion around children, or feed them nonsensical lies and euphemisms when the subject can't be avoided. We avoid teaching children about homelessness, poverty, racism, sexism, bigotry, and oppression. We don't introduce them to concepts of war, genocide, and slavery. We pretend that murder, sex crimes, abuse, and neglect don't exist. We entirely avoid the subjects of disability and horrible mental illnesses, leaving our children to hear of them for the first time in classrooms.\n\nI believe that, 95% of the time, it is wholeheartedly harmful to shield these kinds of harsh realities.\n\nHere are the few cases where I believe it may be good to shield children from reality: when those children are incapable of understanding the truth. For example, I would not try teach my hypothetical children about rape, because they could not remotely understand why someone would want to rape. However, for almost everything else, children are very capable of understanding a difficult topic if you are there to guide them.\n\nI believe that shielding a child from a harsh reality will almost always harm them in the long run. For example, if a close family member dies, it is better to tell the child exactly what happened and even how they died. As a grieving parent, it will be painful and difficult to see your child deal with this reality. However, understanding is the first step to coping and recovery, and it is best for the child to go through those phases with a wise and trusted adult.\n\nIf the parent avoids this harsh reality in favor of a comforting lie, the child will feel sad and confused. This state of mind will linger until the child temporarily forgets about it. These smothered feelings, when left unaddressed, can and do easily lead to mental health issues, because children's emotions can be as deep and complex as those of adults. When the child grows older and realizes the truth, it will likely hit them harder than if they were children, and in a time when they are likely trying to cope with other difficult realities of becoming an adult.\n\nI believe that introducing children to these harsh realities helps them grow into _informed_, _happy_, and _capable_ adults:\n\n* Introducing difficult and controversial topics to children will give them that many more years to hear about it, learn about it, process it, and ultimately form a more informed opinion.\n\n* If you grow up understanding the true nature of the world, that true understanding will become the norm for you. You even may not feel as averse to those harsh realities as your parents feel. However, if you grow up with a false understanding of the world, sooner or later, that harsh reality will collapse, probably in a time when you're already trying to deal with how to live independently. In the long run, avoiding harsh realities makes children more miserable as adults.\n\n* If you have a good grasp of reality, and you feel comfortable with your place in it, then you are less likely to feel intimidated, and more likely to feel capable and make a positive difference in the world.\n\nI believe that the arguments for shielding children from harsh realities are emotional, cowardly, and short-sighted.\n\nSome argue that the joys of childhood should be protected and preserved. I think this is ridiculous because (1) nobody remembers that much of their childhood, and (2) most adults say they enjoy adulthood more than childhood anyway. I think the argument is short-sighted, because it does not consider the likely long-term effects of shielding children from reality.\n\nAnother common argument seems to be that it is simply too dishearteningly painful to see children learn about reality. I think this is ridiculous because (1) dealing with reality is an inevitable part of life, and (2) most parents are clearly projecting themselves onto their children when imagining how they would react.\n\nI think we need to treat children more like adults. Children are not stupid, and the more that we believe that they are, the stupider they will act. If you give children responsibility, you may be surprised by how easily they step up to the task. If you treat children like adults, you may be surprised by how mature they act.\n\nI believe we live in a culture where we treat children like babies, then act surprised and irritated when they don't instantly start behaving like adults at age 18.\n\nIf you're interested in understanding my viewpoint a little more, I highly recommend listening to [this episode](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/557/birds-bees) of the radio show _This American Life_.\n\nI know I make my argument in very general terms, but I will keep it that way, because it supports a general viewpoint I have. Hence, I encourage replies to be argued generally as well.\n\nI hope I have changed your view, and I challenge you to change mine!\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

While more expensive to build, a European home will survive generations longer than a North American home. Why then, do contractors and home owners continue to demand homes built out of relatively flimsy wood in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and other states where once-in-a-decade storms can turn them to debris in minutes?

The home I grew up in was built in 1989 and made of wood. When we had a 6.8 magnitude earthquake in 2001, two large cracks formed: one in the living room and one in the stairway to the basement. There were also many places where, if you took a step in a room upstairs, you could hear the creak in the ceiling downstairs. Our house was next to a forest. The beams that supported our deck were made of wood. When my uncle, a housing inspector, came over in 2000, when the house was only ten years old, he found mold in those beams. \n\nWe moved into a condo in 2007 that was built in 2004. It was on a hill that had previously been the site of an oil refinery. The condo was also built of wood and drywall. In the nine years we lived there, a massive horizontal crack formed in the wall between my bathroom and the kitchen. We talked to our neighbors and they had similar problems.

{"archived": false, "author_name": "Imortulus", "body": "I'd like to start by setting some boundaries to my view. I'm specifically referring to the UK, where the Labour party leader wants to increase the minimum wage from roughly \u00a36/7 to \u00a310 an hour, while also getting rid of zero-hour contracts. I am in no way condoning countries where people are being almost literally being paid peanuts for their work.\n\nI'll deal with minimum wage and zero-hour contracts interchangeably throughout this argument, as they can be used thus for the purpose of my argument. I shall also use an example of McDonald's for this argument, as it seems relevant (Recently, in the UK, McDonald's workers were striking for increased wages and for no more zero-hour contracts).\n\nThe first reason I think increasing the minimum wage (henceforth referred to as M/W) and eliminating zero-hour contracts (henceforth referred to as ZHC) would be more harmful than beneficial is as such:\n\nA large private company, such as McDonald's, wouldn\u2019t double the pay of, or give complete contracts to of all its staff in the UK. If it had to abide by MW increases or no more ZHC, profits would fall. Even if it increased food prices to the consumer to make up for this, profits would fall because McDonald's is fundamentally a low-cost option in the food market. Who would pay Gourmet Burger prices for a Big Mac? Additionally, if all McDonald's wages doubled in the UK, there would be ramifications in terms of what wages were expected elsewhere around the globe. \n\nThe truth is that the primary priority of a publicly listed company like McDonald\u2019s is to deliver value to shareholders, whether we like it or not. To make up for increased MW or no ZHC, McDonald\u2019s would just cut costs. Staff would be laid off and more pressure would be put on a single employee to do the job that two had done previously. Stress in the workplace would increase, and service to the consumer would also worsen. Alternatively, the employees could all just be laid off and replaced by computers. It is true that this would be an investment, but being forced to, say, almost double the wages of McDonald\u2019s workers from \u00a36 to \u00a310/h could provide the impetus to speed up the process which has already taken place in many McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the UK. Sure, some people would benefit from better wages and a certain number of hours a week work. Many others would be fired from a job they needed, and ex-employees wouldn\u2019t even have the unstable or low income that they previously had access to.\n\nSecondly, the majority of the private sector in the UK (and I assume throughout much of the world- but please feel free to disprove me, I'm making a pure assumption here!) is made up of small and medium-sized businesses. About 15 Million people are employed in the sector, mostly by said small/medium businesses. These would be hit the hardest. Suddenly, increasing MW or removing ZHC doesn't affect McDonald's pockets; it's affecting the business owner's own livelihood. They have to lay off employees because they literally don't have enough money in the bank to pay them (slightly exaggerated and rhetorical, one might suggest, but the point stands). \n\nTherefore the outcomes are as such:\n\n1.) SOME employees, say 50%ish for the sake of argument (because if MW roughly doubled and an employer had a set pool of money to pay employees with, they'd only really be able to pay for half as many people. I accept, however, that employers could just take on extra costs, so it could be higher than that figure!) would be better off. They'd have great minimum wage and know that they would get to work a certain amount of hours a week with a decent minimum number of hours. \n\n2.) The other half or whatever % of ex-employees would be stuffed. \"They can just go and get another job elsewhere!\" But the MW increase and removal of ZHC would be universal... so everywhere would be letting go of employees, not taking them on. So, the breadline awaits for potentially millions.\n\n3.) Small businesses can't operate as well, needing a certain amount of work to be done but not being able to pay for enough people to do it.  Imagine if you were a small shop and had two employees selling items to consumers. With one employee, they can handle 50% (or maybe 60% if really pushed) of the work, meaning a huge decrease in revenues. Many small businesses would probably become unsustainable.\n\nPlease, change my view. \n\n\n\n> *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

It is true that this would be an investment, but being forced to, say, almost double the wages of McDonald\u2019s workers from \u00a36 to \u00a310/h could provide the impetus to speed up the process which has already taken place in many McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the UK. Sure, some people would benefit from better wages and a certain number of hours a week work. Many others would be fired from a job they needed, and ex-employees wouldn\u2019t even have the unstable or low income that they previously had access to.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the majority of the private sector in the UK (and I assume throughout much of the world- but please feel free to disprove me, I&#39;m making a pure assumption here!) is made up of small and medium-sized businesses. About 15 Million people are employed in the sector, mostly by said small/medium businesses. These would be hit the hardest. Suddenly, increasing MW or removing ZHC doesn&#39;t affect McDonald&#39;s pockets; it&#39;s affecting the business owner&#39;s own livelihood. They have to lay off employees because they literally don&#39;t have enough money in the bank to pay them (slightly exaggerated and rhetorical, one might suggest, but the point stands). </p>\n\n<p>Therefore the outcomes are as such:</p>\n\n<p>1.) SOME employees, say 50%ish for the sake of argument (because if MW roughly doubled and an employer had a set pool of money to pay employees with, they&#39;d only really be able to pay for half as many people. I accept, however, that employers could just take on extra costs, so it could be higher than that figure!) would be better off. They&#39;d have great minimum wage and know that they would get to work a certain amount of hours a week with a decent minimum number of hours. </p>\n\n<p>2.) The other half or whatever % of ex-employees would be stuffed. &quot;They can just go and get another job elsewhere!&quot; But the MW increase and removal of ZHC would be universal... so everywhere would be letting go of employees, not taking them on. So, the breadline awaits for potentially millions.</p>\n\n<p>3.) Small businesses can&#39;t operate as well, needing a certain amount of work to be done but not being able to pay for enough people to do it.  Imagine if you were a small shop and had two employees selling items to consumers. With one employee, they can handle 50% (or maybe 60% if really pushed) of the work, meaning a huge decrease in revenues. Many small businesses would probably become unsustainable.</p>\n\n<p>Please, change my view. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

A reasonable compromise is proportional distribution of votes based on individual state results.\n\n**\"Winner Take All\" Electoral College** - There are 48 states plus DC that have this rules where winning by 1 vote gives the candidate all the electoral votes of that state. This [map of states](https://i.imgur.com/L4cpWWd.jpg) most visited during the election show the problem that the largest and smallest states are all but ignored. Many elections over the last two centuries and especially in the last 30 years have devolved to the \"battleground states\" ignoring the needs of electoral stronghold states like California and Texas in addition to all the smaller states. If the electoral college is meant to give 3 votes per state then distribute the remaining 385 votes by population to prevent the ignoring of small states, it fails.\n\nIn addition, I'd add this flipping of state colors on results maps gives a more polarized view of the electorate when in reality the states and counties of the nation are more purple (in the 40%-60% results) than straight red/blue. This [voting result map](https://imgur.com/2YrxZW9) of more shaded results in addition to proportional size gives visual backing to this.\n\n**\"Congressional Districts\" Electoral College** - Two states, Maine and Nebraska, practice this insane method where each congressional district's outcome awards the EC vote and the state's overall vote awards the 2 \"senatorial\" EC votes. The insane issue with this is the blatant gerrymandering of many congressional districts such as in Pennsylvania and Illinois that completely creates representatives not in proportion to their electorate. \n\n**National Popular Vote** - This will likely become the method to choose the presidency should enough states pass the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact). While I feel the national popular vote is superior to the winner take all electoral, it is a less than ideal method for presidential voting due to this [50% most populous map by counties](https://imgur.com/215bPKp). Roughly 100 out of the 3000 or so counties in the US contain 50% of the US population. These are dense metropolitan urban areas. There are 14 states that don't have any of these counties and 12 states that only have 1 of these counties. A popular vote for president could likely ignore the needs of these states as was feared 230 years ago when Hamilton came up with the Electoral College. \n\n**\"Proportional Distribution by State\" Electoral College** - This is what I'd argue is the best system with regards to how the United States is set up as a federal republic. This would proportionally award EC votes based on the state's results. To win the presidency, a candidate would need >40% of total EC votes (so 215 or more) and hold the majority of total votes. In event of a tie between two candidates with >40% of EC votes, the winner will be determined by the national popular vote. Otherwise, the top three individuals are chosen by Congress as is the current rule.\n\nConsider this [map of voting results](http://imgur.com/XHNMofH) by states where the pie chart's size indicates EC vote amount. There are democrats, republicans, libertarian in every state and greens in a few. Now here's a [spreadsheet showing proportional distribution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/5g6jik/discussion_post_map_of_each_states_election/dapw83e/) with the result being Clinton - 262, Trump - 262, Johnson - 13 and Stein - 1. However, these results would be very, very different as candidates would have campaigned differently.\n\nWith proportional distribution, every state becomes a battleground where the 1 or 2 EC votes in the middle will be tried to be flipped. You have to campaign for undecided and moderates in all states and not just 4 to 6 of them. In addition, smaller states with less voters per EC are important as group since they have smaller number of voters per EC vote. The 40% EC requirement reduces the impact that third parties can have with regards to throwing the election to the House/Senate while still allowing their representation to be felt on Presidential elections. \n\nBy the way, if you notice, this is a form of Mixed-Member Proportional that's considered a great method of selecting members of House and Congress.\n\n**Changing My View** - So to change my view, you'd have to convince me that either one or both National Popular Vote or Winner Take All electoral college are superior to Proportional by State with regards to electing a President of the US.

From there the story could go in any direction.</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility is a further exploration of the dimensional travel that led to Xen, or a modification of the Borealis storyline in the released outline for HL2EP3, that adds an antigravity property to the dimensional warping field surrounding the ship.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d be very interested to discuss any thoughts you might have about this idea.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

{"archived": true, "author_name": "MisanthropeX", "body": "I have arrived at this view due to the influence and confluence of two philosophies. \n\nPrimarily, my view is influenced by contemporary views such as the open content movement, copyleft movement and advocacy for digital piracy. Simply put, I do not believe a non-physical entity can be \"owned\" or proprietary. Whether it be the data that comprises a song distributed via torrent or the methods of constructing a plains Indian war bonnet, no one can say \"this is my idea, and you cannot use it how you see fit.\" This argument for me is primarily *moral* and *rights-based*. I do not believe that anyone has the right to restrict the usage and evolution of an idea, or that someone's desire to perpetuate their particular idealized version of their culture trumps my right to freedom of expression. Ideas, being non-physical constructs, are inherently free and cannot be locked down.\n\nMy second argument is that of the dialectic. I believe all ideas, when they interact, grow stronger in some capacity from this interaction. The thesis and antithesis become synthesis, and the synthesis is inherently stronger because it has adapted in some way, by either incorporating traits of both influencing theses or having the thesis develop new traits in order to triumph over the antithesis.

Simply put, I do not believe a non-physical entity can be &quot;owned&quot; or proprietary. Whether it be the data that comprises a song distributed via torrent or the methods of constructing a plains Indian war bonnet, no one can say &quot;this is my idea, and you cannot use it how you see fit.&quot; This argument for me is primarily <em>moral</em> and <em>rights-based</em>. I do not believe that anyone has the right to restrict the usage and evolution of an idea, or that someone&#39;s desire to perpetuate their particular idealized version of their culture trumps my right to freedom of expression. Ideas, being non-physical constructs, are inherently free and cannot be locked down.</p>\n\n<p>My second argument is that of the dialectic. I believe all ideas, when they interact, grow stronger in some capacity from this interaction. The thesis and antithesis become synthesis, and the synthesis is inherently stronger because it has adapted in some way, by either incorporating traits of both influencing theses or having the thesis develop new traits in order to triumph over the antithesis. For me, this is a <em>practical</em> argument.

Then how are they not bisexuals? Seems to me that the term only makes sense if they're different in some way from bisexuals, and that way would be that bisexuals are only attracted to men and women, whereas pansexuals are attracted to the gender queer too. But then that strikes me as a rather unflattering redefinition of bisexuality, because there's surely some bisexuals that are fine with getting down with people in the queerer spectrums of gender expression.\n\nAnd then there's demisexuals. Who, I've been told, cannot express sexual attraction to someone unless they have strong romantic feelings. But how is that any different from regular ol' sexuality? I mean, sure, I'll accept there's a gradation between asexuality and \"normal\" sexuality, but I think that just means that someone is perfectly normal, you know? Like if someone usually doesn't have sexual desire, then they're asexual. But if someone just has low sexual desire or sexual desire under specific circumstances, then they're sexual just like anyone else. Because I figure that everyone is sexual (unless they're mostly or totally ace) in different ways, to different degrees, in different circumstances, so I don't see the need to start dividing up the scale between asexual and sexual with specific terms. Strikes me as needlessly complicated, and perhaps even a bit insulting to asexual people who have low but not nonexistent sexual desire, kind of like how the idea of pansexuality seems to only work if someone redefines bisexuality. \n\nAnyways, I want to know if there's something I'm missing here. I would also extend my puzzlement to terms like sapiosexuality and other things I can't, for the life of me, figure out how they're functionally different from bisexuality.

Or say that they're \"better than\" or \"more special than\" the more well-known sexual identifiers.

Roughly [9 *billion*](http://farmusa.org/statistics11.html) chickens are slaughtered each year in the USA *alone*. There is typically zero concern for the welfare of these chickens. [Debeaking without anaesthetic, hormone-driven unnaturally fast growth, and an excessively cruel slaughtering process](http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-are-the-welfare-issues-relating-to-meat-chicken-production_85.html) make the living conditions of these chickens indisputably hellish - and we already *know* that they essentially feel pain in the same way as us. \n\nIt's the sheer scale that matters - even if you think that a chicken can only suffer 0.1% (which I would argue is far too small) of what a human can go through, then you have the equivalent of 9 *million* humans in the USA dying in conditions that are probably worse than slavery *every year*.\n\nCompare this with the slave trade in the USA. In 1860 there were [4 million slaves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_Census) in the USA. This wasn't the number of slaves dying every year - it was the number alive at any given point.

And that's *only* if you assume that meat chickens have an equal quality of life to slaves, which I highly doubt - slaves were never fed growth hormones and were not systematically slaughtered in exceptionally cruel ways.

{"archived": true, "author_name": "The_NZA", "body": "I do not believe rioting is an optimal way to dissent against systemic abuse, but I think people who characterize it as \"useless\" are also selling it short.\n\n.\n\n\nRioting is a barometer of oppressed people lashing out against their condition. Many who disagree with the rioting in Baltimore will agree that it is reacting to something legitimate--police brutality and systematic failings of the courts that prevents them from protecting citizens (especially Black citizens). \n\n.\n\nPeople tend to disagree on whether rioting effectively challenges the problems as it usually punishes poor communities that will need to be repaired by the tax dollars of those same communities that are being mistreated by the police/courts/society.\n\n.\n\nFirst off, I will point to the fact that I do not believe peaceful protests work anymore. The internet and capitalist evolution of the media industry has made it so peaceful protests will never be sensational enough to make headlines--and when they do make the headlines, there are counter opinions being projected on websites/news sources with just as much legitimacy in the public eye (Fox News, CNN, etc). Any foray into /r/news over the past month will reveal the sheer quantity of police related abuses that have been uncovered that failed to make \"prime time\" news. Mr. Dent comes to mind--a Black man who was arrested, beaten in front of a bystander's watching camera. A cop planted cocaine on Dent after the physical abuse--which should have been a prime time story ended up only making the news on the off cycle or in the papers of his home town.\n\n.\n\nThe cop who did these things to Dent was charged (I believe) but this problem superseded the officer's action. The Police chief (?) had the gall to say there was reason to believe the suspect was dangerous before it was clear that video evidence had been taken and brought to light--it reflected an altogether familiar narrative of police abuses happening everywhere in America, and race based police brutality being endemic to these cities. The cop in question had 9 or 10 separate complaints about him abusing citizens, just like the cop who mistreated the Indian Uber driver this month--there is something rotten with the system and it cant be brushed under the carpet by punishing individual actors without analyzing the corrupt house that produced them.\n\n.\n\nNow let's get to rioting. First of all, the worst thing about rioting is that it disproportionately punishes innocent people--this is an undesirable byproduct of rioting and, like many of you, I am at this present moment unconvinced that the byproduct is justified by the positives it accomplishes. Rioting makes everyone suffer but the poor and barely-making-it suffer the worst, who incidentally are also the people who need Justice. In this way, Rioting is completely unfair.\n\n.\n\nHowever, I want to point out some things that happened because of rioting in the past.\n\n.\n\nBut let's talk about a Case example about the positive outcome of riots: the Ferguson riots exploded the case of police brutality into national attention--the media at first was relatively lax about reporting it. I remember I first read about Ferguson when I saw livestreams of protestors being pelted by tear gas and military grade anti-riot gear. The mainstream media only began reporting the situation with urgency afterwards because the sensational chaos was impossible to ignore. The amount of public attention and calamity proved to be too much for Ferguson Police to manage, and as a result the government stepped in. The Government involvement led eventually to the DoJ report, which DID NOT ABSOLVE Mike Brown. [However, what it did do was impressive] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/03/04/the-12-key-highlights-from-the-dojs-scathing-ferguson-report/) (and unsurprisingly underrepresented in the media):\n\n-The city\u2019s practices are shaped by revenue rather than by public safety needs.\n\n-The 67% of African Americans in Ferguson account for 93% of arrests made from 2012-2014.\n\n-The disproportionate number of arrests, tickets and use of force stemmed from \u201cunlawful bias,\u201d rather than black people committing more crime.\n\n-Officers used a dog to attack an unarmed 14-year-old black boy and then struck him while he was lying on the ground, all while he was waiting for his friends in an abandoned house. The report concludes that in every dog bite incident reported, the person bitten was black. (how the fuck was this not reported on more)\n\n-After an officer assaulted a man, he demanded the man not pass out because he didn\u2019t want to carry him to his car.\n\n-From October 2012 to October 2014, every time a person was arrested because he or she was \u201cresisting arrest,\u201d that person was black.\n\nPolice Chief Tom Jackson resigned as a result of the report, as well as Ferguson's city manager, and city's top municipal court judge.\n\n.\n\nI'm not saying the riots in Baltimore will have a silver lining--we will have to see in the end. But already, we have seen Obama address a speech about it implying this case of police brutality that could have been swept away like a dozen others is in the Federal eye. We may see more government intervention, another DoJ report, and possibly this racially charged issue may jump into the same strata as other topics that impact elections and cause policy changes.\n\n.\n\nWe no longer live in the time of the Pentagon papers--we live in a world where Edward Snowden can be silenced, the media can report our loss of privacy in the face of the NSA as unremarkable, and police brutality (even in a sensitive climate) will cause no reaction, or at best, punish individual cops with no consideration for the system. There's no world where the chief justice steps down or the DoJ does a report in Ferguson if the riots didn't happen.\n\n.\n\nI have reason to believe the situation in Baltimore would have livened up a news cycle for a few days before disappearing just like South Carolina if there weren't riots occurring.\n\n.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT:\n\nPlease stop downvoting me because you disagree and instead take some time to respond...isn't that the whole point of this sub?\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Many who disagree with the rioting in Baltimore will agree that it is reacting to something legitimate--police brutality and systematic failings of the courts that prevents them from protecting citizens (especially Black citizens). </p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>People tend to disagree on whether rioting effectively challenges the problems as it usually punishes poor communities that will need to be repaired by the tax dollars of those same communities that are being mistreated by the police/courts/society.</p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>First off, I will point to the fact that I do not believe peaceful protests work anymore. The internet and capitalist evolution of the media industry has made it so peaceful protests will never be sensational enough to make headlines--and when they do make the headlines, there are counter opinions being projected on websites/news sources with just as much legitimacy in the public eye (Fox News, CNN, etc). Any foray into <a href=\"/r/news\">/r/news</a> over the past month will reveal the sheer quantity of police related abuses that have been uncovered that failed to make &quot;prime time&quot; news. Mr. Dent comes to mind--a Black man who was arrested, beaten in front of a bystander&#39;s watching camera. A cop planted cocaine on Dent after the physical abuse--which should have been a prime time story ended up only making the news on the off cycle or in the papers of his home town.</p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>The cop who did these things to Dent was charged (I believe) but this problem superseded the officer&#39;s action. The Police chief (?) had the gall to say there was reason to believe the suspect was dangerous before it was clear that video evidence had been taken and brought to light--it reflected an altogether familiar narrative of police abuses happening everywhere in America, and race based police brutality being endemic to these cities.

{"archived": true, "author_name": "VertigoOne", "body": "The Electoral College is a system that is thoroughly out of date, unfair, undemocratic, and should be abolished entirely in favour of a simple vote count with at most two rounds - (A second day of voting to be held if no one candidate wins more than 50% of the vote. On the second day only the two candidates from the first day with the most votes will be allowed on the ballot)\n\nMany of the central problems with the electoral college are outlined in [this video](http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/the-trouble-with-the-electoral-college.html) but I shall summarise them, and some other points, here\n\n* The Electoral College means that many people's votes are not counted equally. In the current model because of the way the electoral votes are distributed, for example, one voter from Wyoming is worth four voters from California, and one voter from Vermont is worth the same as three voters from Texas.\n\n* The elections are (with a few exceptions) winner take all, which means that up to 49.99999% of the voters in any given state will have their votes count for functionally nothing when it comes to deciding who is president.\n\n* The previous point means the electoral college makes it possible for the electoral college and the popular vote to disagree. Under the current model, you theoretically need as little as 22% of the vote in order to become President. Three times in US history (1876, 1888, and 2000) we have seen the person with less of the popular vote win the overall election because of electoral college distortion.\n\n* The central aim of the Electoral College, to ensure that rural and less populous states get more attention, has been a failure. The electoral college doesn't encourage focus on rural states, it encourages efocus on states with a close victory margin. \n\n* The electoral college depresses voter turn-out, since there are many people who are in a historically \"red\" or \"blue\" state, and do not feel as though there is any point in voting because their side will not win their state, and so their vote will not matter.\n\n* The population of the 100 largest cities in the US only makes up approximately 20% of the total US population. Abolishing the electoral college will not result in presidential candidates only caring about the interest of urban voters. Suburban and rural voters still will matter a great deal.\n\n* By introducing a second round, third party candidates would have a fairer chance of attracting voters without said voters having to worry about splitting the overall vote to their disadvantage.\n\n* The electoral college delegates have the option to vote against the wishes of their populations. This ability is a hangover from the time when the electors were necessary as a means to carry information from the states to Washington. In the current climate, with fibre optic cables that allow information to travel at near the speed of light, this is absolutely unnecessary.\n\n* The solution to situations where the electoral college is tied/no one candidate has more than 50% of the electoral college, is unnecessarily complex and unrepresentative. In the House of Representatives, when called upon to break an electoral college tie, each state gets only one vote. But there are ten states that have more than half of the US's total population, so their rightful representation is shrunk by 30%. See in more detail [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHEDXzOfENI)\n\nEDIT\n\n* The number of electors is linked to the somewhat arbitrary decision of the US government to limit the number of members of the House of Representatives to 435 in 1911. While the decision was made for somewhat practical reasons, this has the effect of constricting and distorting the vote all across the country. With a simple vote count, such distoritions would no longer be necessary. \n\nMy view can be changed if any of the following can be shown:\n\n* If the consequences of changing to a simple vote count would be worse for the US as a whole.\n* If the total vote count can be somehow shown to be unrepresentative.\n* If the defences the electoral college provides to rural etc voters and places can be demonstrated in such a way that said benefits would certainly be gone without the electoral college.\n\nEDIT 2\n\nThere are several reasons why I believe that there should be a second polling day, rather than a simple preferential vote\n\n* Lots of people don't like the complexity of the preferential system.

On the second day only the two candidates from the first day with the most votes will be allowed on the ballot)</p>\n\n<p>Many of the central problems with the electoral college are outlined in <a href=\"http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/the-trouble-with-the-electoral-college.html\">this video</a> but I shall summarise them, and some other points, here</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Electoral College means that many people&#39;s votes are not counted equally. In the current model because of the way the electoral votes are distributed, for example, one voter from Wyoming is worth four voters from California, and one voter from Vermont is worth the same as three voters from Texas.</p></li>\n<li><p>The elections are (with a few exceptions) winner take all, which means that up to 49.99999% of the voters in any given state will have their votes count for functionally nothing when it comes to deciding who is president.</p></li>\n<li><p>The previous point means the electoral college makes it possible for the electoral college and the popular vote to disagree. Under the current model, you theoretically need as little as 22% of the vote in order to become President. Three times in US history (1876, 1888, and 2000) we have seen the person with less of the popular vote win the overall election because of electoral college distortion.</p></li>\n<li><p>The central aim of the Electoral College, to ensure that rural and less populous states get more attention, has been a failure. The electoral college doesn&#39;t encourage focus on rural states, it encourages efocus on states with a close victory margin. </p></li>\n<li><p>The electoral college depresses voter turn-out, since there are many people who are in a historically &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot; state, and do not feel as though there is any point in voting because their side will not win their state, and so their vote will not matter.</p></li>\n<li><p>The population of the 100 largest cities in the US only makes up approximately 20% of the total US population. Abolishing the electoral college will not result in presidential candidates only caring about the interest of urban voters. Suburban and rural voters still will matter a great deal.</p></li>\n<li><p>By introducing a second round, third party candidates would have a fairer chance of attracting voters without said voters having to worry about splitting the overall vote to their disadvantage.</p></li>\n<li><p>The electoral college delegates have the option to vote against the wishes of their populations. This ability is a hangover from the time when the electors were necessary as a means to carry information from the states to Washington. In the current climate, with fibre optic cables that allow information to travel at near the speed of light, this is absolutely unnecessary.</p></li>\n<li><p>The solution to situations where the electoral college is tied/no one candidate has more than 50% of the electoral college, is unnecessarily complex and unrepresentative. In the House of Representatives, when called upon to break an electoral college tie, each state gets only one vote. But there are ten states that have more than half of the US&#39;s total population, so their rightful representation is shrunk by 30%. See in more detail <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHEDXzOfENI\">here</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The number of electors is linked to the somewhat arbitrary decision of the US government to limit the number of members of the House of Representatives to 435 in 1911. While the decision was made for somewhat practical reasons, this has the effect of constricting and distorting the vote all across the country. With a simple vote count, such distoritions would no longer be necessary. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My view can be changed if any of the following can be shown:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the consequences of changing to a simple vote count would be worse for the US as a whole.</li>\n<li>If the total vote count can be somehow shown to be unrepresentative.</li>\n<li>If the defences the electoral college provides to rural etc voters and places can be demonstrated in such a way that said benefits would certainly be gone without the electoral college.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT 2</p>\n\n<p>There are several reasons why I believe that there should be a second polling day, rather than a simple preferential vote</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Lots of people don&#39;t like the complexity of the preferential system. They prefer the idea of one cross in a box etc</p></li>\n<li><p>Preferential voting leaves you more open to the phenomenon of &quot;donkey&quot; voting where people simply put &quot;1, 2, 3, 4&quot; etc in the order that the candidates appear on the ballot. EDIT 3 In a system where you don&#39;t have to vote, or where you don&#39;t need to list all your preferences, you end up with unequal votes, where some people have put more preferences down than others, which - depending on the number of rounds you go through, could lead to discarded votes.

For the most part, people who attend top universities (ivy league, Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford, Caltech, Duke, WashU, Northwestern, UChicago, UC Berkeley, UCLA, etc) are far superior to students attending colleges of mediocre rank (such as big state schools). Why?\n\nStudents at these top schools have it all: academic excellence (high grades, high test scores), extracurricular activities (sports, music, art, etc), leadership involvement, and other compelling and unique sides to them to make them attractive candidates in a grueling and extremely competitive admissions process. \n\nI currently attend UC Berkeley as an engineer, and I'm blown away at the quality of my peers. Many of my peers have razor sharp brains and are extremely hard workers. In addition to that, I know many of my friends who are also involved with campus sports, music groups (I myself play the electric guitar in an alternative rock band), leadership activities (I have friends who lead political clubs on campus), and more. We work hard for sure, but we also have social lives and we play hard: like everyone else, we go to parties, date, socialize, etc (UC Berkeley has a decent Greek life). We will also get excellent jobs once we graduate because top companies actually come to campus to recruit our graduates (same with Stanford and other top ranked schools). \n\nIn my view, students at top schools tend to have a strong work ethic, tend to be competitive while being cooperative (a trait that will help them in life), are ambitious and want to be leaders in the world, and genuinely care about learning about the world and have highly developed passions. Also many aren't \"nerdy\" as the media portrays us out to be: we have romantic relationships, we are social and outgoing and chill, we play sports (and some top schools have top-notch sports teams in addition to academic excellence, like Duke, Stanford, UC Berkeley swimming, etc). Therefore, students at top schools tend to be very well rounded, and are likely to be superior to students at lower ranked schools. \n\nStudents at top schools tend to be disciplined, have good time management, are focused, have a desire to be productive and hard working, and have strong passions that they want to pursue. Moreover, they want to change the world and be leaders for the better. I know many students who as little children were steps above their classmates and developed good study habits, good social skills, musical and athletic talents, and more. And you can be both very skilled as a student and have a social life  (skilled student =/= socially awkward nerd). So saying that students at lower ranked schools may have better social skills isn't necessarily true (there are many \"losers\" at lower ranked schools: people who suck at academics and also at life in general, like having a relationship, being social, etc). Moreover, even if someone is very outgoing at a lower-ranked school, they might not develop oral and communication skills necessary to be charismatic in a professional setting, something that top-ranked business programs teach people to do (I know socially awkward people who majored in business at Berkeley and became some of the most outgoing and smooth people once they graduated). So companies would prefer someone who is professionally smart and charismatic over someone who is street and socially smart, but not professionally smart.\n\nI have a friend who transferred to UC Berkeley from UC Riverside. He told me that Cal is superior in pretty much every aspect: better location, more interesting culture, more interesting students, better sports, better academics, world renowned professors, and more. He told me that the students at Cal are a shitton more academically motivated and take studying/learning very seriously and are disciplined. He also said that Cal students are way more involved in activities and leadership, such as community service, political groups, and extracurricular groups (taiko drumming, intramural sports, etc). You can't say students are top schools are necessarily \"nerdy, shy, and socially awkward\" when so many ppl at Berkeley are active in extracurricular like political activism. He also said that the students at Berkeley were more open minded and friendly than those at UC Riverside (where students according to him were a bit more socially conservative and cold, and many students didn't give a crap about school and goofed off, didn't show up at lecture, and dropped out).\n\nTrue, students at lower ranked schools may have non-academic passions they like, like Photoshop, art, sports, music, and more. But students at top colleges are good that these IN ADDITION to being excellent in academics and being ambitious. So they are superior by being more well-rounded and having more skills. \n\nTherefore when someone says he goes to Columbia or Harvard, that person deserves more respect and is a superior student to someone who attends University of Florida. Moreover, the Harvard grad is likely to be much more economically valuable than a Florida grad since the former will likely have much better skills, skills that employers will find attractive. Also being a Harvard grad is a turn on to the ladies, so that guy won't have trouble in his dating life. \n\nThis excludes people who had the ability to attend high ranked schools but opted to go to a lower ranked school b/c of financial and/or personal reasons. It also excludes legacy admits to top ranked schools.\n\nAlso one could say that there are students who are late bloomers at lower ranked colleges, people who have a lot of potential in life but didn't realize it until college (maybe they slacked off in high school but had the ability to be successful if the wanted to). But then again, isn't someone who was consistently a hard worker (someone who has been an excellent student all of his/her life and worked hard through high school) superior to someone who recently had their eyes opened about the value of education, and only recently tried to change his/her ways for the better? \n\n", "body_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I think it makes sense to judge people based on where they go to college.

Then I pick the conversation back up with something like, &quot;Ok I&#39;m here, go ahead.&quot;  The point is, my phone is still against my ear the whole time.  Apparently that pisses people off?</p>\n\n<p>Customer service workers have an often thankless job--my first job as a teen was at a food service counter, so I know from experience.  I&#39;m not trying to make their day worse, but as long as I make my order clearly and promptly and keep the line moving (and am able to answer any follow-up questions about my order without needing them to repeat themselves), I don&#39;t see what their problem is.  It&#39;s a 5-second transaction, not a first date.</p>\n\n<p>So, in my view, it&#39;s impersonal but it&#39;s not rude.  And yet I sometimes see this complaint somewhere and wonder, &quot;Am I wrong?  Am I being an asshole?&quot;  I don&#39;t want to be an asshole, so go ahead, change my view.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "controversiality": 0, "created": 1386365044.0, "created_utc": 1386336244.0, "delta": false, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "1s8nx9", "link_id": "", "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_1s8nx9", "parent_id": "", "title": "Talking on my cell phone while ordering food or getting a coffee isn't being rude to the cashier or barista.

As a person who comes from that region, leaders and major sections of the population are more likely to have the idea that they are fighting for Islam rather than their country, and never putting their country before their religion. Thats why you see a rise in theocratic leaders, ones who cannot find the secularization of society but want to run a society based on the tenants of islam. The biggest issue with this, besides the fact that you are allowing religion to dictate your decisions, is that there is a massive divide between the Muslims within this region I of course am talking about Sunnis and Shias. \n\nWhen you have a Sunni leader, like Saddam Hussein for example, and you have neighboring countries that are Shia like Iran for example, you create a climate of issues. When the Ayatola (sorry for the misspelling) started trying to rise the Shia against Saddam it was because the Shia felt that they were the minority persecuted against the majority of Sunnis, so they were willing to follow such a leader, and as a result, not only did the Ayatola fail and flee out of Iraq, but the Shia people began to be even more harshly persecuted. Fast forward to after Sadams death, and Maliki became Prime Minister. He was supported by Iran and Syria due to him being Shia, and he had a very sectarian government which persecuted the Sunnis from the Sunni perspective and even if people dont accept the argument that he did persecute them, then again its sunni peoples acceptance of the seperation between this religion which caused them to view Shias as persecuting them. This caused support for a group like Isis who wanted to restore Sunni rule because the Sunnis felt persecuted themselves. Not only do Sunni and Shias in this region participate in this issue, but Sunnis and Shias all around that region with there being documents that Saudi Arabia originally funding Sunni groups such as ISIS. Now with Isis, if you support them there will be massive genocides against Shias in the future, and even if you support the \"moderate\" Syrian rebels against Isis and the leader of Syria, they are a all Sunni group which again means there is a support for a sectarian group, who will be unpopular in a sectarian Syria which is mostly Shia. Again, if a group of people feel they are being persecuted, or feel that their lives are not getting any better, they will accept groups who identify with them so we could see a Shia equivalent of Isis in a few years to over throw Sunni leadership. \n\nThis is the equivalent of the Catholic Protestant issues in Europe during and after the times of reformation. When Protestants and Catholics lived in countries within a same region, there were wars such as the thirty years war and in the 1500's all those religious wars. What allowed Protestants and Catholics to live with one another (eventually, but of course theres still violent divide within places such as Ireland for example) is the unification within one country by putting the good of your country before the good of your religion. With a secular society, no one can rationally feel persecuted since laws will not benefit one section of the population over another. \n\nIf you have a society that doesn't accept a separation between church and state, then elections will be pointless since the population will fear what will happen if they dont have religious laws, and will vote for the theocratic leader. In the 1500's can we say that our system of democracy would have worked? Religious monarchs, or religious leaders would have still ruled supreme because they would have scared individuals who have never known anything but religion into believing that anyone who is secular or protestant would destroy the holy roman empire, and anyone catholic wouldnt have won in the protestant sections of Europe for the same fear. The people need to read the texts and know the history of democracy and relate their experiences to the terrible experiences of the people before democracy flourished and then democracy can prevail, democracy cannot come first and then the texts become available because then it wont work because it will be forced onto people and when you force a philosophy onto people they wont appreciate it or accept it since its being forced.

The definition varies among regulating jurisdictions, but usually includes semi-automatic firearms with a detachable magazine and a pistol grip, and sometimes other features such as a flash suppressor or barrel shroud.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon\n\nIt would be banning a weapon that is not a threat. Out of the 11961 murders in the US during 2015, only 248 occurred with rifles of any kind. To put this into perspective 1567 murders occurred with knives, 435 with blunt objects, and 5562 occurred with handguns. I do not believe that to be enough of a problem to ban them.\n\nIt would not ban equally effective rifles. A Ruger Mini 14 is a semiautomatic 5.56 carbine that uses a box magazine, yet is not considered an assault weapon even though for all intents and purposes it is just as effective as a AR15 which is one. Another similar case is with the M1A and the AR10. All of these weapons were modeled after guns used by the US military and are effective designs.\n\nThe cost of such a ban would vastly outweigh the benefits\nEven if such a ban reduced the number of rifle deaths by 100%, such a ban would cost so much that more lives could be saved elsewhere for far cheaper\n\nMini 14:\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/zMtKFZA\n\nM1A:\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/PPcKwP5\n\nAR 15 and AR 10:\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/iMo8k5E\n\nMurder by weapon type:\nhttps://www.quandl.com/data/FBI/WEAPONS11-US-Murders-by-Weapon-Type \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

The definition varies among regulating jurisdictions, but usually includes semi-automatic firearms with a detachable magazine and a pistol grip, and sometimes other features such as a flash suppressor or barrel shroud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon</a></p>\n\n<p>It would be banning a weapon that is not a threat. Out of the 11961 murders in the US during 2015, only 248 occurred with rifles of any kind. To put this into perspective 1567 murders occurred with knives, 435 with blunt objects, and 5562 occurred with handguns. I do not believe that to be enough of a problem to ban them.</p>\n\n<p>It would not ban equally effective rifles. A Ruger Mini 14 is a semiautomatic 5.56 carbine that uses a box magazine, yet is not considered an assault weapon even though for all intents and purposes it is just as effective as a AR15 which is one. Another similar case is with the M1A and the AR10. All of these weapons were modeled after guns used by the US military and are effective designs.</p>\n\n<p>The cost of such a ban would vastly outweigh the benefits\nEven if such a ban reduced the number of rifle deaths by 100%, such a ban would cost so much that more lives could be saved elsewhere for far cheaper</p>\n\n<p>Mini 14:\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/zMtKFZA\">https://imgur.com/gallery/zMtKFZA</a></p>\n\n<p>M1A:\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/PPcKwP5\">https://imgur.com/gallery/PPcKwP5</a></p>\n\n<p>AR 15 and AR 10:\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/iMo8k5E\">https://imgur.com/gallery/iMo8k5E</a></p>\n\n<p>Murder by weapon type:\n<a href=\"https://www.quandl.com/data/FBI/WEAPONS11-US-Murders-by-Weapon-Type\">https://www.quandl.com/data/FBI/WEAPONS11-US-Murders-by-Weapon-Type</a> </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Hello, users of CMV!

{"archived": true, "author_name": "billingsley", "body": "Three pillar of my changeable view:\n* America desperately needs an immediate minimum wage increase right now today. \n* It should be $10.10/hour nationally. States and cities can raise it from there based on their own regional costs of living. \n* Nationally, it should be raised periodically, tied to inflation. \n* There is a such thing as too high. $15/hour is too high. \n\n**TLDRs in bold!**\n\nObviously, I'm not even going to entertain arguments that say minimum wage is too high (at $7.25) or shouldn't exist. I'm just going to skip that. \n\n**Earning less than $10/an hour is akin to slave labor - even without considering cost of living.** In 2012 I worked a very very labor intensive job for $9.50/hour. I was a been merchandiser. I was responsible for lifting heavy cases of beer all day long. It really felt like salve labor. I made about $1300 over the summer while I finished the final requirements of my college degree. I was living on campus and student loans/parents were paying for my food and housing. So the money I made was just savings and pocket money. Forget about cost of living, it still felt like I was a slave. **That's why the increase to $10.10 should be immediate** - not a gradual increase of the next four years. \n\nIt should increase periodically commensurate with inflation, not once a decade, but every other year. So that we're not having this same conversation again in a decade: people working 60 hours and still homeless. \n\nI don't know what mathematical formula the Obama administration used to come up with $10.10/hour, but that amount seems fair to me. It's not so much that you can get comfortable flipping burgers but it's enough that you can earn money without being enslaved.  **I really feel like $15 is too high.**  You're not supposed to be comfortable flipping burgers. People who support that are just ignoring drawbacks to a high minimum wage. \n\n\nTry to change my view either way - to $15/hour or if you're republican try to convince me in the opposite direction.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

States and cities can raise it from there based on their own regional costs of living. \n* Nationally, it should be raised periodically, tied to inflation. \n* There is a such thing as too high. $15/hour is too high. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDRs in bold!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Obviously, I&#39;m not even going to entertain arguments that say minimum wage is too high (at $7.25) or shouldn&#39;t exist. I&#39;m just going to skip that. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Earning less than $10/an hour is akin to slave labor - even without considering cost of living.</strong> In 2012 I worked a very very labor intensive job for $9.50/hour. I was a been merchandiser. I was responsible for lifting heavy cases of beer all day long. It really felt like salve labor. I made about $1300 over the summer while I finished the final requirements of my college degree. I was living on campus and student loans/parents were paying for my food and housing. So the money I made was just savings and pocket money. Forget about cost of living, it still felt like I was a slave. <strong>That&#39;s why the increase to $10.10 should be immediate</strong> - not a gradual increase of the next four years. </p>\n\n<p>It should increase periodically commensurate with inflation, not once a decade, but every other year. So that we&#39;re not having this same conversation again in a decade: people working 60 hours and still homeless. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know what mathematical formula the Obama administration used to come up with $10.10/hour, but that amount seems fair to me. It&#39;s not so much that you can get comfortable flipping burgers but it&#39;s enough that you can earn money without being enslaved.  <strong>I really feel like $15 is too high.</strong>  You&#39;re not supposed to be comfortable flipping burgers. People who support that are just ignoring drawbacks to a high minimum wage. </p>\n\n<p>Try to change my view either way - to $15/hour or if you&#39;re republican try to convince me in the opposite direction.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Hello, users of CMV!

I meant somebody that would be non-functional for the whole of their lives.

Eugenics is still a good idea to me, but it seems that the idea of forcing it upon people is where it goes to shit. Instead, it seems the best point would be to offer screenings for people looking to have kids, that will tell them their child's health and let them decide ultimately. \n\n**Edit 4:** While I still think that the idea behind eugenics is a good one, as it aims to make the human population as disease free and \"perfect\" as possible, I will admit that it is flawed for numerous reasons listed below. Deltas have been awarded for those who pointed them out:\n\n1) Implementation. It would be almost impossible to implement due to the massive uproar from the citizens of any government.\n\n2) Decisions. Who would get to decide what traits are to be removed? This seems to be the biggest arguments against it since everybody will have different ideals as to what traits are deemed \"unfavorable\"\n\n3) Costs. The costs involved would likely significantly outweigh the costs of taking care of those with the traits looking to be eliminated. \n\n4) Quality of life. Quality of life is too hugely subjective to be decided on for everybody by a single person or governing body.

Unable to walk, speak, or even feed themselves and require a constant caretaker from birth to death. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> A Commenter has pointed out that such restrictions would limit the genetic diversity of the human population, a thought that hadn&#39;t yet crossed my mind.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> At this point, I&#39;ll admit that the idea of sterilization is bad. Eugenics is still a good idea to me, but it seems that the idea of forcing it upon people is where it goes to shit. Instead, it seems the best point would be to offer screenings for people looking to have kids, that will tell them their child&#39;s health and let them decide ultimately. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> While I still think that the idea behind eugenics is a good one, as it aims to make the human population as disease free and &quot;perfect&quot; as possible, I will admit that it is flawed for numerous reasons listed below. Deltas have been awarded for those who pointed them out:</p>\n\n<p>1) Implementation. It would be almost impossible to implement due to the massive uproar from the citizens of any government.</p>\n\n<p>2) Decisions. Who would get to decide what traits are to be removed? This seems to be the biggest arguments against it since everybody will have different ideals as to what traits are deemed &quot;unfavorable&quot;</p>\n\n<p>3) Costs. The costs involved would likely significantly outweigh the costs of taking care of those with the traits looking to be eliminated. </p>\n\n<p>4) Quality of life. Quality of life is too hugely subjective to be decided on for everybody by a single person or governing body. As one commenter put it &quot; your average person with Down Syndrome lives a happier life than a bipolar genius.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "controversiality": 0, "created": 1492470963.0, "created_utc": 1492442163.0, "delta": false, "downs": 0, "edited": true, "gilded": 0, "id": "65w579", "link_id": "", "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65w579", "parent_id": "", "title": "CMV: Eugenics Is A Good Idea, Just Gone About In The Wrong Way In The Past", "ups": 19, "user_reports": [], "violated_rule": 0}
